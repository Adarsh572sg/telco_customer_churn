# Telco Customer Churn

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data, create visualizations, and build predictive models to identify customers who are likely to churn.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` - Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration, visualization, and modeling.
- `data/` - Includes datasets used for analysis (not included in this repository due to size constraints).
- `models/` - Stores trained models and relevant outputs.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Adarsh572sg/telco_customer_churn.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd telco_customer_churn
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis and results.

## Project Details
### Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It contains information about customer demographics, account information, and services used.

### Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Results and Conclusion

### Models
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict customer churn, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Results
The best performing model is the Gradient Boosting classifier with an accuracy of 82%. The analysis highlights key factors influencing customer churn, such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
